<h1>Mason Eugenio</h1>
<p>My name is Mason Eugenio and I am 20 years old. 
I am taking many computer science related classes online for my computer science degree. 
I enjoy long walks on the beach (not really I just like staying indoors). 
I like watching shows and reading stories online.
So basically I stay indoors for most of the actifities I enjoy.
